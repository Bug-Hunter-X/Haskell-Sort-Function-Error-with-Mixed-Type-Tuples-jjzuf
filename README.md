This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `sort` function from `Data.List` with lists containing tuples of mixed types. The `sort` function relies on the default comparison function which cannot compare different types, leading to a runtime error. The solution involves using a custom comparison function with `sortBy` to handle different types appropriately.  The `bug.hs` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected code.
